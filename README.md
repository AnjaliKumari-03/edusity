# 🎓 University/College Website – React JS Project

This project is a modern, responsive university/college website built using **React.js** and **Vite**. It's designed to showcase an educational institution’s offerings, programs, testimonials, and branding in a clean and professional way.

The project is component-based, modular, and styled using individual CSS files per component. It's ideal for learning React fundamentals, structuring multi-page apps, and preparing for real-world React development.
